    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Traditional Indian dish made of spiced cauliflower and potatoes. This dish is steamed and then fried in oil making it intentionally dry and somewhat crispy. </p>
    <p>WARNING: This dish is extremely spicy, which is the way I like it. However, if you don't like your food that spicy, feel free to cut down on the serrano pepper 
        and/or cayenne pepper. Also, I would recommend serving this with a side of raita or plain yogurt to cool the mouth down after eating. </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cumin seed</li>
        <li>1 small onion, quartered and sliced</li>
        <li>2 serrano chile peppers, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>2 medium baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 head cauliflower, cut into florets</li>
        <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4></li>
        <p>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat in a large pot. Fry cumin seeds for a few seconds 
            until they turn golden brown and begin to pop. Reduce heat to medium, stir in the onion, and cook 
            until lightly browned. Stir in serrano pepper and ginger; fry for 1 minute. Season with coriander, 
            paprika, turmeric, cayenne, and garam masala; cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.          
        </p>
            <li><h4>Step 2</h4></li>
        <p>Stir potatoes and salt into the pot, cover, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Add cauliflower, cover, 
            and cook until cauliflower steams in its own juices until tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in lemon 
            juice. Pour remaining 1 tablespoon of oil around the edges of the pot. Increase heat to medium-high 
            and fry for 3 to 5 minutes to brown, stirring gently to avoid mashing the cauliflower.
    </ul>
